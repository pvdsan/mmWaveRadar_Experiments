# Introduction
This is a research project under MORSE Studio Georgia State University under Dr. Ashwin Ashok<br/>
The project aims to understand feasibility of using mmWave Radar setup to detect tiny drone imitating a fly/mosquito with the help of range, doppler and sound signatures of the object of interest<br/>
Special Thanks to Argha Sen, IIT Kharagpur, for allowing us to refer https://github.com/arghasen10/mmHER for the raw data streaming and parsing code using DCA1000EVM<br/>

## Hardware Setup
Step 1: Make sure the IWR6843ISK (mmWave board) is connected with the mmWAVEICBOOST and DCM1000EVM along with the swicthes as follows<br/>

Step2: Make sure you have flashed the DCA1000EVM with the apt FPGA image using the Lattice Diamond Programmer. See document: https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruij4 under FPGA - SPI Flash Programming Mode
