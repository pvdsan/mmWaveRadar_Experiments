# Introduction
This is a research project under MORSE Studio Georgia State University under Dr. Ashwin Ashok<br/>
The project aims to understand feasibility of using mmWave Radar setup to detect tiny drone imitating a fly/mosquito with the help of range, doppler and sound signatures of the object of interest<br/>
Special Thanks to Argha Sen, IIT Kharagpur, for allowing us to refer https://github.com/arghasen10/mmHER for the raw data streaming and parsing code using DCA1000EVM<br/>

# Initial Setup

### Hardware Setup
Make sure the setup with the mmwave radar in this case IWR6843ISK along with mmWaveICBoost and DCM1000EVM is as follows below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### mmWave Studio Configuration Setup
Run the dataCaptureScript.lua from the repository in the mmWave Studio
Make sure you have flashed the DCA1000EVM with the apt FPGA image using the Lattice Diamond Programmer. See document: https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spruij4 under FPGA - SPI Flash Programming Mode
